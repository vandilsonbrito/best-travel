# Best Travel 

<p>This is a Search Flight Application called Best Travel. I'm using Amadeus API (test mode) to fetch flights data.</p>
<p>It is possible to search for flights based on origin/destination autocomplete input, dates and passengers quantity, and choose only one-way or return flights. After choose the flight you fill it up a form with personal info, so then you recceive the booking information with book code, value, passenger(s) sirname(s), etc.</p>

<h2>Acquired Experience</h2>

I Learned a lot with this project. Starting with TypeScript, it was my first bigger project using TypeScript and I had to use a lot of interfaces to type objects and some events from HTML, so I practiced a lot.
It was my first time using react-query to fetch data and zustand as a state management. I discovered how easy is the process to display data from an API using react-query as a personalized hook and using props like 'isFetching' and 'refecth'.
